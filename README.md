Human Development Index Analysis Application
1. scrapes the most recent HDI score for each country from the Wikipedia
HDI article;
2. gets the data for each country in the HDI list using restcountries API
(find more information on this list on https://restcountries.com/).
3. analyses the correlation between HDI score and countriesâ€™
characteristics;
4. saves the analysis result to [current_date].txt file.
